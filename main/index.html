    <h2>About Our Expense Tracker</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
<p>Our expense tracker is designed to make managing monthly expenses simpler and more efficient. It helps users organize their spending by tracking transactions, categorizing expenses, and managing payment methods. With these tools, users can gain better insights into their finances and stay on top of their budgets.</p> <p>This website is not intended for public use or everyday consumers. Instead, it is built to manage the backend database of the expense tracker, providing an interface for administrators to organize and oversee the system. Through this platform, administrators can handle data related to users, transactions, expense categories, and payment methods with ease.</p>    <br></br>
